CoBe - CoBe - Master

The Master class is the main entry point for the CoBe project. It is responsible for
They
    - can configure mapping between cameras and reals space by communicating with a Calib object
    - can be started (main action loop)
    - when started in each iteration call Eyes via Pyro5 to get the latest inference results
    - can remap detections according to camera mapping
    - can call the Pmodule and consume its results
    - can pass final coordinate results to the projection stack via Unity
